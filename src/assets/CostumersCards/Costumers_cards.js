        review:"Very nice discovery! Homemade burger with great homemade sauces. Fries too. We tried the blue cheese burger (a killer), the pimento and the jalapeño. The chorizo in the pimento was top-notch, with a tangy sauce. The burgers were beautifully presented, and the service was fast. We recommend it!",

        review:"We ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them.When the waiter asked if everything was ok, we said we really didn't like the chips and he said 'That's funny, I love them' and that was it.

        review:"A sunny day, a little hunger, let's go for a falafel sandwich, with a refreshing yuzu drink, and a fruity dessert, to share for two! It's the perfect way to spend some quality time, with delicious Lebanese dishes. It's minimalist, and it's perfect that way! Our favorite is the best falafel in Bordeaux!",

        review:"Having been a customer for many years, we wanted to thank and congratulate the new owners on a delicious time spent in their establishment. The carpaccios, the pasta, everything was perfect: the welcome, the service, the wine and even the digestifs. A superb menu at reasonable prices.",
